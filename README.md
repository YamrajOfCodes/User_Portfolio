# User PortFolio

This is a lightweight portfolio website featuring a single-page layout with sections for skills, projects, experience, and contact information. The design prioritizes responsiveness, accessibility, and straightforward presentation. The goal is to provide a quick overview of who I am, what I build, and the technologies I work with. Ideal for recruiters, clients, or anyone reviewing my work.

## What's Inside

- Fully responsive design with Tailwind
- Modular, reusable components 

## Built With

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite as the build tool

## Best Part
I intentionally completed the design without relying on AI tools. While using them could have made the layout perfectly pixel-aligned, I chose to handle it manually to demonstrate my own attention to detail and design accuracy.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
